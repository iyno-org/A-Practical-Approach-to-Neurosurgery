# Introduction
### Why I started writing this book?
A lot of neurosurgical books are intended for Neurosurgical professionals. Many books of Neurosurgery (and medicine in general) appear more as newspapers rather than as books.

A Proper Introduction to Neurosurgery tries to change that. This book is designed to be as engaging as possible while helping you retain as much information as possible.

### Who is this book for?
This book is intended for students studying Medicine. At the end of my first year as a medicine student, our medical school requires every student to participate in a summer internship. Me being me, I chose Neurosurgery because I had set my mind from the very beginning that this is what I would like to do for the rest of my life.
>How do you understand everything that is happening in the OR?
1. I had no professional training in the neurosurgical field and this is why I decided to write this book. To provide the basic essential knowledge to any medical student so that they can understand the neurosurgeon.
2. Even if you do not meet a neurosurgeon in the OR, you can go to their office and ask for their advice in studying Neurosurgery and when they notice that you know what you are talking about, they may provide you with exclusive opportunities to work alongside them on different projects.
